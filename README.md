## Why did I create this language?
I was bored one day and decided to learn how programming languages work, so I did some research, I practiced the concepts that I was learning, and then decided to create this programming language! I've had a few setbacks for many things along my journey of building the language, but I can safely say that this is one of my favorite projects that I've done!

There isn't much I can really say about the language as it is still in it's early development stage, however, if you would like to see the many updates and such that I've done to the language, feel free to read [Updates.md](https://github.com/OzRAGEHarm/zekken/blob/main/Updates.md#early-development-build-1-22325)!
