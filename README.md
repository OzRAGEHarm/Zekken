Zekken is a general-purpose language created purely with the Rust programming language, meant to be easy to learn and understand!

## Why did I create this language?
I created this programming language because I was bored one day and didn't know what to do, so I decided to learn how programming languages work.

## Documentation
There isn't much documentation that I can resourcefully give as the language is still in early developement stages and hasn't fully matured and/or been tested 100%.
