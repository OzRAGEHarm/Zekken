Zekken is a general-purpose language created purely with the Rust programming language, meant to be easy to learn and understand!

## Why Zekken?
- **Performance**: Fast and Effient for most applications. (see [Benchmark](https://github.com/OzRAGEHarm/Zekken?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmark) for more info.)
- **Reliability**: Create code faster and easier than that of other languages.
- **Easy to learn**: Zekken's syntax is easy to understand and learn.

## Benchmark:
| Language | Execution Time |
|:---------|---------------:|
| Zekken | 0.35 seconds |
| Javascript | 4.149 seconds |
| Python | 2.222 seconds |
| Rust | 4.703 seconds |

## Documentation
There isn't much documentation that I can resourcefully give as the language is still in early developement stages and hasn't fully matured and/or been tested 100%.
